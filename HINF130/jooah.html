    <h2>more about me</h2>
    <p>I heard about health informatics from my high school counsellor, while talking to him about my future career path and choices. I wanted to be in the field of medicine but I didn&apos;t want to go into the sciences because I didn&apos;t really like sciences but math. So my counsellor suggested this program as it requires some mathematical skills as well, so I thought this program is the best one I&apos;ve found for myself so far. I took Programming 12 in high school, so I know a bit of python and C++ but I do not have prior experience with XML and HTML.</p>
